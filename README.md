## Binary Search
### 704
Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1. You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity. You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
> Example 1:  
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9  
Output: 4  
Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4  

> Example 2:  
  Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2  
  Output: -1  
  Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1  

Solution1: Left close, right close:
```
class Solution {
public:
    int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int left = 0, right = nums.size() - 1;
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] == target) return mid;
            if (nums[mid] > target) right = mid - 1;
            if (nums[mid] < target) left = mid + 1;
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
//nums = [-1, 0, 3, 5, 9, 12], target = 8
//left = 0, right = 5, left < right, mid = 2, nums[mid] = 3 < target, left = 3
//left = 3, right = 5, left < right, mid = 4, nums[mid] = 9 > target, right = 3
//left = 3, right = 3, left = right, mid = 3, nums[mid] = 5 < target, left = 4
//left > right, break, return -1;
```
Solution2: Left close, right open:
```
class Solution {
public:
    int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int left = 0, right = nums.size();
        while (left < right) { //Difference1
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] == target) return mid;
            if (nums[mid] > target) right = mid; //Difference2
            if (nums[mid] < target) left = mid + 1;
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
//nums = [-1, 0, 3, 5, 9, 12], target = 8
//left = 0, right = 6, left < right, mid = 3, nums[mid] = 5 < target, left = 4
//left = 4, right = 6, left < right, mid = 5, nums[mid] = 12 > target, right = 5
//left = 4, right = 5, left < right, mid = 4, nums[mid] = 9 > target, right = 4
//left = right, break, return -1;
```

## 33 Search in Rotated Sorted Array
There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).
Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].
Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
>Example 1:  
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0  
Output: 4  

>Example 2:  
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3  
Output: -1  

>Example 3:  
Input: nums = [1], target = 0  
Output: -1  

```
class Solution {
public:
    int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int left = 0, right = nums.size() - 1;
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] == target) return mid;
            if (nums[mid] > target) {
                if (nums[mid] >= nums[left] && nums[left] > target) left = mid + 1; // mid = left is possible
                else right = mid - 1;
            }
            if (nums[mid] < target) {
                if (target > nums[right] && nums[right] >= nums[mid]) right = mid - 1; // mid = right is possible
                else left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
};

//nums[mid] > target: separate nums into two ascending parts, the first part is always "higher" than the second part. If nums[mid] and target are in the same part, we could use the normal binary search logic. However, if nums[mid] and target are in the different part, (if nums[mid] > target, then nums[mid] will be in the first part and target will be in the second part), then there must be nums[mid] >= nums[left] > target (nums[mid] could equal to target but nums[left] will not be equal to target), and we will make left = mid + 1;

//nums[mid] < target:
//Same to the previous scenario, if nums[mid] in second part and target in first part, then there will be target > nums[right] >= nums[mid] and we will make right = mid - 1;
```
